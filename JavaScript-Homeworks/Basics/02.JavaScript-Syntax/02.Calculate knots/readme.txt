Type:

node cylinderVol.js

while you are in the current* directory and have node.js intsalled



*How to get to "current" directory(windows 7 and plus):
 - go one level up
 - you should be able to see folder "02.Calculate knots"
 - hold down shift key + right mouse click
 - open comand prompt here
 - paste "node cylinderVol.js" without quotes

or you can just run it through Webstorm -> node.js

Have fun! :)
